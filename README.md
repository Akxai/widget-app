# Widget App

Widget App is a customizable and feature-rich application that helps you stay organized and manage your tasks effectively.

## MyCustomWidget - Minesweeper Widget

The `MyCustomWidget` component in the Planner App is a Minesweeper-like game that features flags and bombs. The objective of the game is to avoid clicking on bombs. Once a user clicks on a bomb, the game ends.
It's not fully minesweeper, just you should avoid clicking on a bomb rather reveal all the flags.
and I've set my custom widget's area to **floating**

### Implementation

The `MyCustomWidget` component is implemented using React and JavaScript. It utilizes the `useState` hook to manage the game state, including the game board, game over status, opened cells count, mines, and flags. The game logic is handled through event handlers and recursive functions to reveal cells and check for game over conditions.

### How it Works

1. The game board is initially empty, and the player can start a new game by clicking the "Start New Game" button.

2. The game board is displayed as a grid, with each cell representing a square on the Minesweeper board. Clicking on a cell reveals its content.(ðŸš© or ðŸ’£)

3. The goal is to avoid clicking on cells that contain bombs. If a cell with a bomb is clicked, the game ends, and the player loses.

4. The player should find all the flags.

5. If a player finds all the flags without clicking on any bombs, they win the game.

6. The game board dynamically adjusts its size based on the rows and columns specified. By default, the board is an 8x8 grid with 10 randomly placed bombs.

7. The game provides feedback on the game over status, displaying a "Game Over" message if the player clicks on a bomb or a "You've won!" message if they successfully find all the flags.
